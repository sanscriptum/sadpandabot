# sadpandabot

A discord bot which grabs E-Hentai metadata for E-Hentai links in the chat using discord.py. Get support [here](https://discord.gg/SWpwrtC). There probably isn't any invites for the bot instance I host due to the server limit for unverified accounts.

## Installing and running

Use the docker image for simple installation, otherwise, use `python >= 3.5` and install the packages in `requirements.txt`. Also set the `DISCORD_TOKEN` env variable (or edit the code to use your discord token).

```
git clone https://github.com/sanscriptum/sadpandabot
cd sadpandabot
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 sadpandabot.py
```

### docker

```
docker run -e "DISCORD_TOKEN=<your discord token here>" cotangent/sadpandabot:latest
```

### administration

There is a rudimentary administration interface provided via the [jishaku](https://github.com/Gorialis/jishaku) cog which exposes the [discord.py API](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/rewrite/) to you. Command prefix is `s!` so to call `jishaku`, `s!jsk py await _ctx.send("hello world!")`.
